/////////////////////

v2.2.3
	- Fixed a problem importing the asset.

v2.2.1
	- Now, when combining meshes of Anima2D characters, an atlas will be generated!
	- More functions have been added to the "Only Anima2D Meshes" merge mode.
	- Fixed bugs with the Anima2D merge
	- Updated documentation
	- The combined mesh render script has been improved.
	- Now it is possible to export in PNG the atlas generated during the merge of Anima2D meshes.
	- You can now view the atlas generated during the merge of Anima2D meshes in the "Stats" tab.

v2.1.1
	- Small housekeeping in scripts
	- Fix a bug with welcome messages

v2.1.0
	- Small improvements in the descriptions of each component option in the Inspector.
	- Now the Skinned Mesh Combiner has full support for Anima2D from Unity Technologies. The Skinned Mesh Combiner now recognizes
	  and can work side-by-side with the Anima2D tool.
	- Added new merge method: "Only Anima2D Meshes". This is a merge method that only combines skinned meshes generated by the Anima2D tool 
	  from Unity Technologies! Now you can combine your skinned meshes generated from sprites (from Anima2D) using the Skinned Mesh Combiner MT
	  and enjoy the features of both tools!
	- Updated documentation with the new features!

v2.0.1
	- Made minor improvements to the code.

v2.0
	- Added option to save atlas files with encoding and PNG format.
	- Added full support for Specular Maps.
	- Added full support for Metallic Maps.
	- Added two new integrated shaders: Standard Specular and Standard Specular Culling Off.

v1.9
	- Fix of small bugs.
	- Small adjustments to the tool.
	- Added the "Logs of Merge" tab (in the "Skinned Mesh Combiner" component interface). Now you can see all the logs
	  that the Skinned Mesh Combiner emits through the Inspector. So you do not have to look for logs on the Unity console, you can see each separate log.

v1.8
	- Improvements in the organization of the source code.
	- Added full support for Normal Maps!
	- Added two more pre-created shaders to the Skinned Mesh Combiner!
	- Minor bug fixes!
	- Added a new algorithm for processing atlas, to give full support to effects like Normal Maps! (For All In One method)
	- Added options so you can configure the final material generated by the merge in the "All In One" method.
	- The All In One method was developed from the beginning, with the to merge meshes that use textures. To improve the
	  efficiency of this merge method, now each material must have a main texture associated with it. The mesh that has a
	  material with no main texture will be ignored.
	- Added option to automatically generate prefab after merge.
	- Added full support for Secondary Normal Maps!
	- Added full support for Height Maps!
	- The Skinned Mesh Combiner component now has a tab that displays the merge statistics, and atlases generated after merge.
	- Merge statistics are now always automatically generated when combined using the Editor. These statistics will be displayed
	  in the "Stats" tab of the "Skinned Mesh Combiner" component.
	- Added full support for Occlusion Maps!
	- Added full support for Detail Albedo Maps!
	- Added full support for Detail Albedo Maps!
	- Added a new merge method! "Just Material Colors". This new merge method, just does the job of combining all the colors of
	  your materials, into an atlas image. Perfect for people who do not use textures in their materials, just colors.
	- Documentation updated and improved even more!
	- In-editor merge management has been improved.
	- Now you can also see a preview of how the atlas was generated after the merge, through the "Stats" tab.

v1.7
	- One of the most powerful updates of the Skinned Mesh Combiner!
	- Fixed a compatibility problem in the "All In One" method that incorrectly mapped the atlas in the merged model.
	- Improvements in compatibility with newer versions of the Unity Engine.
	- Bug fixes.
	- Merge processing time of the "All In One" method has been reduced by up to 30%.
	- The documentation has been updated!
	- The 65,000 vertices limitation has been removed. Now you no longer have to worry if your merged model will grow to 65,000 vertices!
	- The minimum support version is now Unity 2018.1.0f2. This change was made to ensure future improvements to the tool!
	- More is to come. Stay tuned!

v1.6
	- This update has brought a lot of minor improvements.
	- Bug fixes on newer versions of Unity Engine.
	- The next versions will bring great improvements to the Skinned Mesh Combiner MT. Get ready!

v1.5
	- Added an option to improve compatibility between the various model formats (.fbx, .blend, and many others).
	- Now when you combine meshes and choose to save the data in your project, the previous data will not be overwritten.
	  Now you can continue to create your prefabs, but without any fear of losing the old data!
	- Now, when you undo the merge (using the editor), the data saved in your project will also be deleted
	  (if you have enabled saving data in assets). This will prevent useless files from consuming disk space on your project!
	- The component now detects when you are missing important merge files and warns you (if you have enabled the option
	  to save the merge files in your project).
	- Documentation has been enhanced with the new features! Enjoy!

v1.4
	- The demo scene has been enhanced to better exemplify the merge API at runtime. To view the demonstration,
	  start the simulation of the scene and use the buttons. You can see the script on the Canvas to study it
	- Added some more details in the documentation
	- Small optimizations
	- Fixed bug when building game with tool
	- Fixing small bugs

v1.3
	- The asset art has been redefined for some improvements.
	- A small improvement in post merge statistics has been made. You can now see the optimization rate after the merge.

v0.2
	- Added a protection mechanism and notification for incompatibility, during the merge of meshes using
	  different root bones.
	- The documentation will now include the current version of the asset in the title.

v0.1
	- The Skinned Mesh Combiner has just been released! I will always be working to support and add new features!
